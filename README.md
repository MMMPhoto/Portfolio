# Portfolio

## Module 2 Challenge for the the GT bootcamp: Portfolio web site
This Week 2 Challenge tested my skills in Advanced CSS. We were tasked with building a portfolio website from scratch that would showcase our work as a web developer. I started out this project wanting to make sure my page was responsive and behaved the way I wanted, regardless of content. I primarily built the page using flexbox elements, and I held off on visually styling the page until the page functioned the way I wanted it and was responsive to varying screen sizes.

Next, I added the content itself and adjusted the structure of the page along the way. Finally, I added visual styling with uniform colors and tweaked everything.

I have plans to add more responsivness, such as hover functionality for links, but I needed to make sure I met all the Acceptance Criteria for the assignment, and in the spirit of Agile, I understand that in future versions of the site, I will be able to improve the site even more than I was able to at this stage.
